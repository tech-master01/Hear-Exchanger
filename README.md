# Hear-Exchanger
âœ… What is a Heat Exchanger?  A heat exchanger is a device that transfers heat from one fluid to another without the fluids mixing. It is used in a wide range of industries, including chemical, oil &amp; gas, power generation, HVAC, and food processing.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Principle

Two fluids (hot and cold) flow in separate paths.

Heat is transferred through a solid barrier (usually metal).

Can work with liquid-liquid, gas-gas, or gas-liquid combinations.

ðŸ”¸ Common Applications

Cooling hot process fluids

Heating cold streams

Condensation (vapor â†’ liquid)

Evaporation (liquid â†’ vapor)

Waste heat recovery

ðŸ”§ Types of Heat Exchangers

1. Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger

2. Plate Heat Exchanger

3. Air Cooled Heat Exchanger (Fin Fan Cooler)

4. Double Pipe Heat Exchanger

5. Spiral Heat Exchanger

6. Plate-Fin Heat Exchanger

7. Condenser & Reboiler (special duty)
